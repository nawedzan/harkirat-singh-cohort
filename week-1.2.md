**why languages**
need something to convert an idea to machine level code either lnaguages are comiped or interpreted
these programs are either stored on ssd and run on ram
vlc is written in c and c++
when we click on vlc the whole application doesnot go into the ram part of applications code goes into the ram in the form of 0 and 1 in vlc
these conversion of high level code is done through compiler and interpreter
in compiled lang there is an extra step of converting the entire code to 0 and 1 
but in interpreted language the code is read line by line
